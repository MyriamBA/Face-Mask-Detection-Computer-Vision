# Face Mask Detection using Computer Vision - YOLOV5
In this project, we have collected images and generated a Dataset for three classes and used YOLOV5 to accomplish multicass detection, specifically identifying whether individuals are wearing a mask correctly, not wearing it or wearing it incorrectly from the generated dataset using PyTorch.
The Suggested Model achieved excellent values in detecting the three classes with an accuracy with arround 88%.
